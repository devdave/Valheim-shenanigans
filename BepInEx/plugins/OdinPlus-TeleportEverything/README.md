## About

This mod adds extra excitement and functionality to the portal system. You can use it to bring wolves to the fight or lure trolls into a trap! These modes also work in dungeons, so it's possible to bring a wolf into a mountain cave or have a wraith follow you into the crypt.

It's recommended to Install a [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/) to change mod configurations in game using the `F1` key.

### **Important**
  1. Install on both server and clients for better use
  2. ServerSynched settings can only be changed by the server owner

> Note: There are some settings that only appear when you enable the advanced options in your configuration manager.

## Want to teleport faster?
Try using also the [QuickTeleport mod](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/QuickTeleport/). It works perfectly with teleport everything and several other mods.

## Features

### Teleport Modes:

**All Teleport Modes allows you to teleport allies** and select your transport **Ally Mode**(tamed, named, only follow...). Read the documentation bellow to see all modes.

1. **Standard**. 
    Vanilla portal behavior.

2. **Vikings don't run**. 

    If this mode is selected from the **F1** configuration manager menu, portals will not work with enemies nearby. This makes escaping combat through portals more challenging, but not impossible.

3. **Take them with you**. 

    If this mode is selected from the **F1** configuration manager menu, enemies within the search range will have a chance of following you through the portal. Set the search range to a high number and watch out!

## Usage:

### **Message Mode**
* Change display message mode: 
    1. top left
    2. center
    3. none

### **--- Portal Settings ---**
* Portal Activation Range (advanced): You can increase or reduce the activation range. The default game value is 5 meters.
* Portal Sound Volume: Change between 0 and 100%. The default game value is 80%. You may need to rejoin the session or teleport to a distant portal for changes to take effect.

### **--- Portal Behavior ---**
#### Teleport Mode
1. Select the teleport mode: Currently you can select "**Standard**" which will give you vanilla behavior.  "**Vikings don't run**" mode will prevent you from teleporting if mobs are within a search sphere. "**Take them with you**" will give mobs a chance of following you through the portal. If this mode is selected, a dash through the portal with a troll in pursuit may end up in troll fight within your base! Its a super fun mode.
2. Currently, enemies will spawn at a random location within 6 meters (default) of the portal.

 Hey, if you want to bring some greydwarves through the portal with you, no one will judge ;). You can bring hostile creatures as easily as tamed ones.

 #### Search Radius (advanced)
 * Configurable search radius for creatures in meters, found in the F1 configuration menu.

___

### **--- Transport Allies ---**

#### Ally Mode
 If this mode is toggled on, allies within the search range will teleport with you. This includes wolves, boars, lox, or any creature. 

* Define the Ally Mode from the dropdown list using the **F1** configuration menu. At present, you can select either: 
  1. "No Allies",
  2. "All Tamed", 
  3. "Only Follow", 
  4. "All tamed except Named", 
  5. "Only Named".

> There are quick check boxes to select wolves, boar, or lox. You can also advanced filter which allies can be teleported by enabling the filter mask and entering the creature's prefab name (e.g. "greydwarf,wolf"). (In this case, only Greydwarfs and wolves allies would be allowed). You can obtain the prefab names list easily on the web.

#### Transport Radius and Vertical Tolerance (advanced)
* Teleport Everything searches for allies within a search cylinder. It should not be necessary but you can configure the radius and height of the search cylinder to meet your needs. For example, you might set the height to 1.5 meters in order to avoid transporting allies on different levels of your base.

#### Spawn Forward Tolerance (advanced)
* Define how far your allies will spawn in front of you in meters. The default is 1.5 meters.

#### User Filter Mask / Server Filter Mask (advanced)
* Enable Server/Player Filter Mask (advanced): 
    * If enabled, **only** allies in the Transport Mask field will be allowed
    * If disabled, **all tameable** allies can be teleportable
* Server and Player Transport Masks (advanced): accepts comma-delimited list of [prefab names](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/prefabs/character-list.html). E.g.: wolf,lox (you can also use regex inside this field, e.g.: `human_\w+` will allow all `human_1`,`human_2`,`human_anything`).

#### Transport Boars / Lox / Wolves
* Three checkboxes that players can quickly enable/disable teleporting each creature. Default: all allowed.

___
### **--- Transport Carts ---** (advanced)

![transport-carts-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152506/220641406-59b27b02-25e9-4737-8b40-ce802c4b1a39.gif)

#### Transport Cart Mode
Choose between `Enabled`, `Disabled` and `Only Dungeons`. Synched with the server. Your player needs to be attached to the cart to transport it.

#### Transport Cart Tax Items
If Trasport Cart is enabled, switch on/off taking fee from prohibited cart items. It uses the Transport Fee configured on the server.

___
### **--- Transport Enemies ---** (advanced)
* These enemies settings are only appliable if "**Take Enemies With You**" is selected in the **Teleport Mode**.

#### Spawn Enemies Forward Tolerance
* The minimum distance enemies will spawn in front of you when teleported. Default 6 meters.

#### Max Enemy Spawn Radius
* The maximum radius enemies will spread in front of you when teleported. Default 3 meters.

#### Enemies Mask Mode
* Choose between **Disabled, Block or Allow Only** to use the Enemies Mask field.

#### Enemies Mask
* Write the prefab names of the enemies you want to follow/block, separated by a comma, depending on the Enemies Mask Mode.
___
### **--- Transport Items ---**
#### Transport Dragon Eggs / Transport Ores
* If toggled on, players can transport **ores, ingots, and eggs**. 

#### Transport fee (advanced)
* In order to offset the advantage of transporting ores, players may set a **"transport fee"** that deducts a percentage of the contraband ores, ingots. For example, a 10% fee would take 3 out of 30 ores. Default: 0%.
* Dragon eggs are not taxed by default, but you can change it in the Remove Fee field.

#### Remove Transport Fee From Items (advanced)
* You can use the field to Remove the transport fee from specific items using their [prefab names](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/prefabs/prefab-list.html). 
By default, the fee from `DragonEgg` is removed, but you can change it if needed.

* Advanced: [Regex expressions](regexr.com/70okv) are allowed, for example `boss_crystal_\w+` will remove the fee from any `boss_crystal_1`,`boss_crystal_2`,`boss_crystal_999`... (we automatically add a regex `\b` in the beggining and end to delimit the strings separated by comma)

If you want to add your own translation locally, you can create a file based on the [English.yml template](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/957320383424503949/1040075435674968094/English.yml) anywhere inside the Bepinex folder. The file should be named `TeleportEverything.Language.yml`. For example, the file for Spanish translation would be `TeleportEverything.Spanish.yml`.

You can find Valheim's Languages list [here](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/localization/language-list.html).

### Built-in translations
Currently we have these translations in the mod: `English, French, German, Portuguese_Brazilian, Russian and Spanish`. You can send me your translation on odin plus discord if you want it added to the mod and available to other players in a later version.
