## Patreon
I spend countless hours every day working on, updating, and fixing mods for everyone to enjoy. While I will never ask for anyone to pay me to make a mod or add a feature, any support is greatly appreciated. >>[Check it out﻿](https://www.patreon.com/Menthus)<<, you might find benefits that catch your eye!

## Configuration
**You have 2 methods of configuration:**

<b>Note:</b> The default config file included with the mod closely emulates the vanilla values for buying and selling items.

1. Going to Valheim\BepInEx\config and opening Menthus.bepinex.plugins.BetterTrader.cfg.
2. Using the >>[BepInEx ConfigurationManager﻿](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases/tag/v16.1)<< plugin. Simply download it, put it in your Valheim\BepInEx\plugins folder, and press F1 when in-game.

**You have a growing list of configuration options:**

#### [A_General.Trader]
**Trader Wait For Discovery (defaults to true):** True means the Trader will only sell items the player has discovered.  
**Trader Price Fluctuation (defaults to true):** True means the Trader's prices will fluctuate every so often (the amount to fluctuate by and time it takes before the Trader's prices fluctuate are configurable).  
**Trader Price Fluctuation Scale (defaults to 0.3):** Determines how much the prices should fluctuate from the base price of an item.  
**Trader Price Fluctuation Frequency (defaults to 1):** How many days that pass between each price fluctuation.  
**Trader Has Coins (defaults to true):** True means the Trader will use coins to purchase player items (the Trader's starting coin amount and time it takes before the Trader's coin reset are configurable).  
**Trader Base Coin Amount (defaults to 2000):** How many coins the Trader has as a baseline.  
**Trader Coin Refresh Frequency (defaults to 2):** How many days need to pass before refreshing the Trader's coin amount to [Trader Base Coin Amount].  
**Trader Can Repair Items (defaults to true):** True means the Trader can repair items for the Player.  

#### [B_General.ItemTypes.NameOfItemType]
**enabled (defaults to true):** True means every item of this type is enabled.  

#### [C_Items.NameOfItemType.NameOfItem]
**Purchase Price (defaults to 100):** The base amount the Trader sells this item for (before fluctuating/scaling if [Trader Price Fluctuation] is true).  
**Sell Price (defaults to 100):** The base amount this item can be sold for by the Player.  
**Tradeable (defaults to false):** True means the Trader will sell this item to the Player.  
**Sellable (defaults to false):** True means the Player can sell this item to the Trader.  
**Ignore Trader Wait For Discovery (defaults to false):** True means this item will show up in the Trader's purchase list even if [Trader Wait For Discovery] is true and this item hasn't been discovered by the Player yet.  

**Example of an item's price being fluctuated**  
    ﻿priceFluctuationFactor = basePrice * TraderPriceFluctuationScale;
    newPrice = basePrice + Random.Range(-priceFluctuationFactor, priceFluctuationFactor);

## Installation (manual):
1. This mod requires >>[BepInExPack](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases/tag/v16.1)<< to work. Follow the BepInExPack installation instructions, then place the BepInEx folder (from the Better Trader download) into the Valheim folder. Make sure to replace all if you have a previous version of Better Trader installed!
2. If you're playing the game in a different language **and you are missing items**, you must run the game in English and load into a world first. Then you can swap it back to your language and continue from there.
