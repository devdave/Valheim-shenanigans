Populated Villages, PopVillages in short, makes player friendly NPCs (tamed) spawn on Draugr Villages and a few other locations AFTER you kill the enemies from that area.

# Special Thanks

A special thanks to ASharpPen123 for all the help to get my mod working with Spawn That and to neurodr0me for all the RRR Core mods.

# Description

These NPCs are just commoners that need your help for everything but at least you have a better reason to build a new village or restore their old one.

The NPCs will spawn 3 minutes after the Draugr Village is clear but sometimes they might start spawning while you still fighting. While it's not intented to spawn  them with enemies left, if they die they'll respawn 3 minutes later again.

The number of spawned NPCs is based on the prefabs available on that Village. Single houses may spawn 2 or 3 Human Commoners and Long Houses and Great Halls may spawn up to 3 Commoners with a chance of spawning a Guard NPC.

They WILL RESPAWN even if you destroy entirely the buildings and build new ones. The spawns are based on the rooms created for Local Spawners and dont need the actual constructions.

Also one prefab building on the Black Forest Biome and another one (the biggest ruins) on the Mountains Biome will spawn friendly NPCs. These allies will come from their hidding to join forces with the Odin's Champion in the 10th World after witnessing his deeds.

All the NPCs were tested and they can't hold on their own for long. Actually except for the guards most of them will die quickly in case of a raid.

The mod was created to give players who wanted to restore those villages or create small cities to populate them. Using these NPCs in combat may break your Valheim experience even with their low stats.

IMPORTANT: Sage Robesï»¿ is needed and in my mod. I made this other mod so the NPCs can now have different clothing and looks better this way and could support better the PopVillages.
